## SkipShop

**Live demo →** https://skipshop.netlify.app/

A tiny React + Vite storefront proof-of-concept built from reusable components.

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Core UI | `SkipCard` (product card), `BottomSheet` (portal slide-up modal), `SkipSelector` (stateful grid) |
| Styling | Tailwind utilities, custom `animate-slideUp` key-frame, green accent palette |
| UX polish | Hover-lift cards, focus rings, scroll-lock on modal open (removed on close) |
| Build | `npm run build` → optimized bundle in `dist/` |
| Git | Local init → `git remote add origin` → pull/force-push to sync, `.gitignore` keeps `node_modules` & `dist` out |

Feel free to drop that into your `README.md` so visitors can click straight to the deployed site.
